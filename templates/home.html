    <h2>Site Payment Management</h2>
    <p>
      Our team of experts simplifies the payment process for your clinical trial. 
      By comparing the costs in your clinical trial agreement with the visit and procedure data in your 
      EDC (Electronic Data Capture) system, we accurately calculate the payments owed to sites, 
      investigators, patients, and all other service providers, including pharmacies and labs.

    <h2>Reconciliation</h2>
    <p>
      We ensure financial accuracy and foresight for your clinical trial. 
      Our process reconciles costs in clinical trial agreements and amendments against payment records, 
      forecasts future payments based on key study milestones like closure and database lock, 
      and accurately analyzes all Ethics Committee payments stemming from protocol changes.
